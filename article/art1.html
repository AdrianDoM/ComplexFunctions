  <h1 class="title">An Introduction to Complex Numbers</h1>
  <div class="text">
    <p>
      This article is the first on a series about complex variables and functions
      on them. In this instalment we provide an introduction to complex numbers, assuming
      no prior knowledge on the subject. Familiarity with real numbers, plots of real
      functions on the \(xy\)-plane, vectors in \(\R^2\) and polar coordinates will prove
      useful throughout the series.
    </p>
    <h2>What are complex numbers?</h2>
    <p>
      Without further ado, let us give a formal definition of what a complex number is.
    </p>
    <div class="def">
      A <em>complex number</em> is a number of the form \(a + ib\), where \(a\) and
      \(b\) are real numbers and \(i\) is the <em>imaginary unit</em>, for which we
      have that \(i^2 = -1\). The set of all complex numbers is denoted by \(\C\).
    </div>
    <p>
        Perhaps you are wondering what the meaning of this new number \(i\) is.
        It is clear that \(i\) doesn't belong in \(\R\), for there is no real number
        such that its square is \(-1\). Instead of a number, you can think of \(i\) as a mere
        symbol, a placeholder, for which we have the rule \(i^2 = -1\). Using this
        new symbol, we can express the roots of other negative real numbers in a new
        way. For example, \(\sqrt{-9} = 3i\), for we have that \((3i)^2 = 3^2 i^2 =
        9 \cdot (-1) = -9\).
      </p>
    <p>
      Note that every real number \(r\) is also a complex number, since it can be
      written as \(r + i0\), so we can think of \(\C\) as an extension of \(\R\).
      In fact, if we think of \(\R\) as the real line, the addition of this 
      imaginary unit creates a completely new dimension and so we can picture
      \(\C\) as the <em>complex plane</em>. Analogous to the \(xy\)-plane, we
      represent the value of \(a\) on the \(x\)-axis and the value of \(b\) on the
      \(y\)-axis. For some complex number \(z = a + ib\), these valued are called
      the real part of \(z\) (written as \(\re z\)) and the imaginary part of \(z\)
      (written as \(\im z\)), respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an interactive representation of the complex plane. You can left-click
      on it to plot a complex number. Use the mouse wheel to zoom and the middle
      button to pan (this can also be done using SHIFT + left button).
    </p>
    <div class="plot" id="intro-plot">
      <canvas width="400px" height="400px"></canvas>
      <p class="math"><span>\(z = 1+i\)</span></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      As you can see, the similarities with the \(xy\)-plane are evident and it will
      often be useful to think of complex numbers as vectors in \(\R^2\). For this, we
      simply associate the vector \((a,b)\) and the number \(a+ib\).
    </p>
    <h2>Operations with complex numbers</h2>
    <p>
      As you might have expected, we can perform arithmetic with complex numbers. For
      addition and subtraction, this is done in a similar way to vectors in \(\R^2\).
    </p>
    <div class="def">
      Let \(z\) and \(w\) be two complex numbers with \(z = a + ib\) and \(w = c + id\),
      where \(a, b, c, d \in \R\). We can add and subtract them as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>
          \(z + w = (a + ib) + (c + id) = (a+c) + i(b+d)\)
        </li>
        <li>
          \(z - w = (a + ib) - (c + id) = (a-c) + i(b-d)\)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      Note how in our definition we had to specify that \(a, b, c, d \in \R\).
      The reason for this is that the representation \(z = a + ib\) is not unique
      if we let \(a\) and \(b\) be arbitrary complex numbers. For example,
      \(1 + 0i\) could also be written as \(0 + i(-i)\). For our purposes,
      however, we will always assume that, when we write \(z = a + ib\), \(a\)
      and \(b\) are taken to be real.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case of multiplication is not so simple. We can't borrow multiplication
      from of vectors, plainly because there is no multiplication between two-dimensional
      vectors that yields another two-dimensional vector. Instead, we use the rule
      \(i^2 = -1\) to multiply two complex numbers algebraically.
    </p>
    <div class="def">
      Let \(z = a + ib\) and \(w = c + id\) be two complex numbers. We have:
      $$zw = (a + ib)(c + id) = ac + ibc + iad + i^2bd$$
      $$ = (ac - bd) + i(bc + ad)$$
    </div>
    <p>
      At first sight, this definition has no apparent geometric meaning, but we will
      soon uncover the secrets of complex multiplication. For now, have a go at
      multiplying two complex numbers on the complex plane.
    </p>
    <div class="multi-plot" id="mult-plot">
      <div class="plot">
        <canvas width="250px" height="250px"></canvas>
        <p class="math"><span>\(z=1\)</span></p>
      </div>
      <div class="plot">
          <canvas width="250px" height="250px"></canvas>
          <p class="math"><span>\(w=i\)</span></p>
      </div>
      <div class="plot">
          <canvas width="250px" height="250px"></canvas>
          <p class="math"><span>\(zw=i\)</span></p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Do you notice anything interesting? Try setting \(w\) to \(i\) and move \(z\)
      around. How about now? Perhaps visualising both \(z\) and \(zi\) in the same
      plot will help you see what's happening:
    </p>
    <div class="plot" id="imult-plot">
      <canvas width="400px" height="400px"></canvas>
      <p class="math"><span>\(z=1\)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; and &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>\(zi=i\)</span></p>
      <p class="math"></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      It is easy to see the pattern now: multiplying by \(i\) rotates \(z\) by a
      right angle counterclockwise. In fact, complex multiplication has a lot to do
      with rotation, but in order to explain this relation we will need to introduce
      the system of <em>polar coordinates</em>. Before we do this, however, we will
      introduce two more operations on complex numbers.
    </p>
    <div class="def">
      Let \(z = a + ib\). We define the conjugate of \(z\), writen \(\bar{z}\) and
      read <q>z bar</q>, as \(a - ib\).
    </div>
    <p>
      Geometrically, the conjugate is the reflection of \(z\) about the \(x\)-axis.
      One of the most important properties of \(\bar{z}\) is that \(z\bar{z} = 
      (a + ib)(a - ib) = a^2 - b^2 + i(ba - ab) = a^2 + b^2\) is always a real number.
      We can now use this fact to introduce division of complex numbers.
    </p>
    <div class="def">
      Let \(z\) and \(w\) be as usual. We can divide them as follows:
      $$\frac{z}{w} = \frac{a + ib}{c + id} = \frac{a + ib}{c + id}\frac{c - id}{c - id}
      = \frac{ac + bd}{c^2 + d^2} + i\frac{bc - ad}{c^2 + d^2}$$
    </div>
    <h2>Polar coordinates</h2>
    <p>
      So far we have determined a point \(z\) on the complex plane by specifying its
      real and imaginary parts (\(x\) and \(y\) values if you wish), but there are other
      ways of uniquely defining a point on the plane. Seen as a vector, each complex
      number has a modulus (its distance to the origin) and it describes an angle with
      the \(x\)-axis, which we call its argument. These two properties are actually
      sufficient to determine a single point on the plane and thus we could use them
      as a coordinate system, which we call <em>polar</em>.
    </p>
    <div class="def">
      Let \(z = a + ib\) be a nonzero complex number. Its <em>modulus</em> \(|z|\) is given by
      \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Its <em>argument</em>, denoted \(\arg z\), is any \(\theta \in \R\)
      such that \(z = |z| (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)\).
    </div>
    <p>
      Note that \(\arg z\) is not unique; in fact, if we have such a \(\theta\) then
      \(\theta + 2\pi\) is also a valid value for \(\arg z\). It will sometimes be useful
      to restrict \(-\pi < \theta \leq \pi\), then this number is unique and we call it
      \(\Arg z\). We can then write \(z\) in <em>polar form</em> as \((r, \theta) = (|z|,
      \Arg z)\).
    </p>
  </div>
