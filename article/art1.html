  <h1 class="title">An Introduction to Complex Numbers</h1>
  <div class="text">
    <p>
      This is the first on a series of articles about complex variables and functions
      on them. This first instalment acts as an introduction to complex numbers, assuming
      no prior knowledge on the subject. Familiarity with real numbers, plots of real
      functions on the \(xy\)-plane and vectors in \(\R^2\) will prove useful throughout
      the series.
    </p>
    <h2>What are complex numbers?</h2>
    <p>
      Without further ado, let us give a formal definition of what a complex number is.
    </p>
    <div class="def">
      A <em>complex number</em> is a number of the form \(a + ib\), where \(a\) and
      \(b\) are real numbers and \(i\) is the <em>imaginary unit</em>, for which we
      have that \(i^2 = -1\). The set of all complex numbers is denoted by \(\C\).
    </div>
    <p>
        Perhaps you are wondering what the meaning of this new number \(i\) is.
        It is clear that \(i\) doesn't belong in \(\R\), for there is no real number
        such that its square is \(-1\). Instead of a number, you can think of \(i\) as a mere
        symbol, a placeholder, for which we have the rule \(i^2 = -1\). Using this
        new symbol, we can express the roots of other negative real numbers in a new
        way. For example, \(\sqrt{-9} = 3i\), for we have that \((3i)^2 = 3^2 i^2 =
        9 \cdot (-1) = -9\).
      </p>
    <p>
      Note that every real number \(r\) is also a complex number, since it can be
      written as \(r + i0\), so we can think of \(\C\) as an extension of \(\R\).
      In fact, if we think of \(\R\) as the real line, the addition of this 
      imaginary unit creates a completely new dimension and so we can picture
      \(\C\) as the <em>complex plane</em>. Analogous to the \(xy\)-plane, we
      represent the value of \(a\) on the \(x\)-axis and the value of \(b\) on the
      \(y\)-axis. For some complex number \(z = a + ib\), these valued are called
      the real part of \(z\) (written as \(\re z\)) and the imaginary part of \(z\)
      (written as \(\im z\)), respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an interactive representation of the complex plane. You can left-click
      on it to plot a complex number. Use the mouse wheel to zoom and the middle
      button to pan (this can also be done using SHIFT + left button).
    </p>
    <div class="plot" id="intro-plot">
      <canvas width="400px" height="400px"></canvas>
      <p class="math"><span>\(z = 1+i\)</span></p>
    </div>
    <script>
      let plotDiv = document.getElementById('intro-plot'),
      canvas = plotDiv.querySelector('canvas'),
      span = plotDiv.querySelector('span')

      let
      z = new Variable('z'),
      plot = new Plot(canvas, undefined, z),
      display = new Display(span, z)
      z.set(math.complex(1,1))
    </script>
    <p>
      As you can see, the similarities with the \(xy\)-plane are evident and it will
      often be useful to think of complex numbers as vectors in \(\R^2\). For this, we
      simply associate the vector \((a,b)\) and the number \(a+ib\).
    </p>
    <h2>Operations with complex numbers</h2>
    <p>
      As you might have expected, we can perform arithmetic with complex numbers. For
      addition and subtraction, this is done in a similar way to vectors in \(\R^2\).
    </p>
    <div class="def">
      Let \(z\) and \(w\) be two complex numbers with \(z = a + ib\) and \(w = c + id\),
      where \(a, b, c, d \in \R\). We define:
      <ul>
        <li>
          \(z + w = (a + ib) + (c + id) = (a+c) + i(b+d)\)
        </li>
        <li>
          \(z - w = (a + ib) - (c + id) = (a-c) + i(b-d)\)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      Note how in our definition we had to specify that \(a, b, c, d \in \R\).
      The reason for this is that the representation \(z = a + ib\) is not unique
      if we let \(a\) and \(b\) be arbitrary complex numbers. For example,
      \(1 + 0i\) could also be written as \(0 + i(-i)\). For our purposes,
      however, we will always assume that, when we write \(z = a + ib\), \(a\)
      and \(b\) are taken to be real.
    </p>
